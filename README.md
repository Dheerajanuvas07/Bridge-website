## 🛑 The Problem

**The "Sandwich Generation" is overwhelmed.**

Millions of adult children are struggling to balance their own careers and families while trying to support their aging parents. They often face a difficult choice:
*   Spend hours every week running errands for their parents, leading to burnout.
*   Hire expensive medical home care agencies for simple, non-medical tasks.
*   Leave their parents without the support they need to age in place independently.

There has been no middle ground—until now.

## 💡 The Solution

**Bridge is a hyper-local marketplace for non-medical senior support.**

We connect families with trusted, vetted local helpers who can assist with the day-to-day tasks that keep seniors independent. We aren't a medical agency; we are a community support network.

*   **For Families**: Peace of mind knowing mom and dad have reliable help for groceries, appointments, and companionship.
*   **For Seniors**: The ability to stay in their own homes longer, with dignity and social connection.
*   **For Helpers**: Meaningful work that supports their local community.

## ✨ What We Offer

We focus on the essential tasks that make a massive difference:

- **🛒 Grocery & Pharmacy Runs**: Door-to-door delivery, putting items away, and checking in.
- **🏥 Doctor Accompaniment**: Reliable round-trip transportation and a companion to wait with them.
- **☕ Companionship**: Friendly visits, light housework, and social interaction to combat isolation.
